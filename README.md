# wlke

wlke (cloud = wolke in german) is a Python Django created Cloud solution for self-hosting. In this Project we want to improof our python - django skills.

## tools

This project is written in Python 3 and HTML. The frameworks that are used are Django for Python and the backend and Bootstrap4 for the frontend.

## try this project

To test this project, simpy clone it an navigate into the wlke folder. If you are there, you can launch the development-server with `python manage.py runserver` on Windows or with `python3 manage.py runserver` on Linux or MacOS.

## use our build virtualenviroment
#### Attention: to make this work, we recommend on Windows to use Git Bash as terminal!!
1. open the terminal in the directory, where also the `README.md` ist stored (main directory)
2. on Windows type `python -m venv env` in the terminal | on MacOS/Linux type in your terminal `python3 -venv env`
3. on Windows (Git Bash) and MacOS type in your terminal `source env/Scripts/activate`
4. then enter the command `pip installl -r requirements.txt`
5. Now you can select in the open folder in VS Code the virtual-enviroment `env` as python-interpreter
